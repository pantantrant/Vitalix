Vitalix 1.0 is an operating system where the goal is the smallest executable size. Input and output to the system is over the COM serial port and that part is written in x86 inline assembly. It supports UEFI only for now.

Vitalix 2.0 added a embedded Java bytecode interpreter into the operating system.
