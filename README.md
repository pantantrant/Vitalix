Right now, I'm trying to figure out how to boot it on bare metal x86 UEFI. I don't want to target BIOS.
Right now, it has a serial input and serial output driver that's written partially in x86 inline assembly,
so this only supports x86 as of right now. I once got it to boot on bare metal but I forgot how, please tell
me what's wrong with anything in here.

It's about executable size not lines of code that's what I mean by code size.
